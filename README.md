# Mini-Discord!
-# NOT ASSOSIATED WITH DISCORD IN ANY WAY THIS IS A INDEPENDENT PROJECT THAT MAY GO AGAINST DISCORD TOS!

# How it works!
Mini discord uses python to load your channels 
onto a batch file and help you run a very
minimal version of discord.

# INCLUDING
- Status updating (online, invisible, dnd, idle)
- Multiple accounts (add an infinite number of accounts using your discord tokens)
- Channel and catagory viewer (shows everything but vc channels)
- Messaging in servers (not in dms currently)

# HOW TO INSTALL
Download the start.bat file and run it in a folder, 
it will do the rest itself!
